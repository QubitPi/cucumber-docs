      <description>Every Wednesday at 10:45 PST we host the new contributors ensemble. This is a space for people who are keen to contribute to open source to get together and support each other in making their first contributions. ðŸ¦„
The Cucumber team is committed to tackling the structural sexism and racism in open source, and we host these sessions to provide a welcoming environment for people who have historically been under-represented in open source.</description>

      <description>Here is a list of Cucumber-related blog posts and tutorials.
Do keep in mind that blogs can become dated quickly with a fast-moving project like Cucumber. Cucumber&amp;rsquo;s documentation should be considered the canonical documentation source with the, hopefully, most up-to-date information. Some very old blog posts may refer to the &amp;ldquo;RSpec Story Runner&amp;rdquo;, since Cucumber started out as a rewrite of that project.

      <description>Getting started and help How do I get started with Cucumber? To get started from scratch, try the 10-minute tutorial. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to get started with a working project (or if you are having trouble getting the tutorial to work), you can get started with the cucumber-java-skeleton. This project is designed to work &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;.
 You can read these docs to learn more about Gherkin, Cucumber and BDD.</description>
